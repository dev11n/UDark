<p align="center"><i>True Unity Dark theme, no light-gray garbage.</i></p>

## Why?
Because Unity's own "Dark Mode" hurts my eyes, it's not a real dark mode. So why not modify the colors to actually make it dark instead?
## Credits
This theme is a reskin of [Adapta](https://github.com/mauricepape/adapta-nokto-for-unity) from Mauri, the reason I decided to reskin his theme is because his theme included most (if not all) CSS/USS properties, saving me hours/days of work.

The colors are inspired from Unreal Engine 5, an engine that sucks for Linux but has a really nice color-scheme.
## Warning
1. Customizing the Unity editor has very little (close to none) documentation, therefore things may break during version changes.
2. There's still elements that remain unchanged/partially unchanged, the theme isn't perfect. Some of the elements that cannot be changed very easily are UI Element-based ones. I'll update the color of more IMGUI elements later on, if you want to help, feel free to send a PR.
3. The theme is made for Unity Dark Mode **only**, so you'll have to give up your eye-killer to Light Mode.
4. I specifically made this theme to go along with my Linux xmonad setup, if it looks weird on Windows (or other Linux DEs) then you'll either have to fix it yourself, or deal with it since I never use Windows with Unity and it's highly unlikely I'll be able to fix it properly.
# Install
Copy the `dark.uss` file into a new folder at `Assets/Editor/StyleSheets/Extensions`, then the theme should be applied. If it isn't, either hit `CTRL + R` or restart the Editor.
